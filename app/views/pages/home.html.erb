      <p>Blogger is an American online content management system which enables multi-user blogs with time-stamped,
       entries. Pyra Labs developed it before being acquired by Google in 2003. Google hosts the blogs, 
       which can be accessed through a subdomain of blogspot.com. Blogs can also be accessed from a user-owned,
        custom domain by using DNS facilities to direct a domain to Google's servers.
        A user can have up to 100 blogs or websites per account.</p>
